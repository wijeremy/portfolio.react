## Description

I built this project to try and get a handle on React. I felt comfortable with it and tried upping the ante to building a MERN app, but I couldn't get mongo to work on Heroku. I will come back to that later.

I learned a lot about how React elements fit together. Some things I assumed turned out not to be true, and there was a lot of trial and error. I manually integrated bootstrap, but I will look into employing react-bootstrap in the future as it looks really cool.
